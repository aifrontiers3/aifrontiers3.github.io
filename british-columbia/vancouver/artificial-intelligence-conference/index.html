Video is naturally multi-modal, offering great possibility for content understanding while also opening new doors like unsupervised and weakly-supervised learning at scale.  Temporal representation remains a largely open problem; while we can describe a few seconds of video, there is no natural representation for a few minutes of video.  I will discuss recent progress, the importance of these problems for applications, and what we hope to achieve.","startDate":"2018-11-09","endDate":"2018-11-09","performer":{"@type":"Person","name":"Matt Feiszli","jobTitle":"Research Manager","affiliation":"Facebook","image":"/images/speakers/3rd/Matt_Feiszli.jpg","description":"Matt Feiszli, Facebook Research Scientist Manager, leads computer vision efforts on video understanding at Facebook.

However, as we will explore in this talk, even state-of-the-art systems have \"blind spots\" which make them generalize poorly out of domain and render them vulnerable to adversarial examples.  We then suggest that more unsupervised learning settings can encourage the development of more robust systems.  We show positive results on two tasks: (i) text style and attribute transfer, the task of converting a sentence with one attribute (e.g., sentiment) to one with another; and (ii) solving SAT instances (classical problems requiring logical reasoning) using end-to-end neural networks.","startDate":"2018-11-09","endDate":"2018-11-09","performer":{"@type":"Person","name":"Percy Liang","jobTitle":"Assistant Professor","affiliation":"Stanford University","image":"/images/speakers/3rd/Percy_Liang.jpg","description":"Percy Liang is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Stanford University (B.S. from MIT, 2004; Ph.D. from UC Berkeley, 2011).

The IoT is predicated to bring trillions to many different industries. The fifth wave represents massive opportunity for the ecosystem to create new businesses and drive economic growth. Those 1T devices will not just be connected, they will be intelligent - a paradigm shift enabled by ML in every IoT end point. The bigger impact of AI is already happening today as machine learning is becoming part of our daily lives in billions of tiny moments. Machine Learning will be needed to handle the massive amount of data that will be part of the fifth wave. Data itself isn’t always valuable if the volume obscures the important info. We can use ML at the edge to identify the critical data that should be shared. This is why we as an industry need to focus on the edge for the future of AI. We’ve worked hard on moving data to processing somewhere else, but for a trillion devices, that approach isn’t sustainable. Moving, processing and storing data all has costs in terms of efficiency and security. We need to shift our focus to processing the data where it is collected and used driving more value from IoT.</span></div></div><span class="related-news">Learn more about Himagiri Mukkamala in the post: <a href="https://aifrontiers.com/2018/08/03/an-inside-look-at-arms-big-push-into-iot/">An Inside Look at Arm’s Big Push Into IoT</a></span><div class="bio"><span class="title">Speaker Bio</span><span class="content">Himagiri (Hima) Mukkamala is senior vice president and general manager for IoT Cloud Services at Arm.

I will focus on two active areas: multimodality and time.  Video is naturally multi-modal, offering great possibility for content understanding while also opening new doors like unsupervised and weakly-supervised learning at scale.  Temporal representation remains a largely open problem; while we can describe a few seconds of video, there is no natural representation for a few minutes of video.  I will discuss recent progress, the importance of these problems for applications, and what we hope to achieve.</div></div></div><div class="speech"><div class="speech"><h3 class="speech-title"><span class="speaker-name">Divya Jain</span>&nbsp;:&nbsp;<span>Video Summarization (<a href=https://www.slideshare.net/AIFrontiers/divya-jain-at-ai-frontiers-video-summarization >Slides</a>)</span></h3><div class="speech-description">As video content is becoming mainstream, video summarization is becoming a hot research topic in academia and industry. Video thumbnail generation and summarization has been worked on for years, but deep learning and reinforcement learning is changing the landscape and emerging as the winner for optimal frame selection.

However, as we will explore in this talk, even state-of-the-art systems have "blind spots" which make them generalize poorly out of domain and render them vulnerable to adversarial examples.  We then suggest that more unsupervised learning settings can encourage the development of more robust systems.  We show positive results on two tasks: (i) text style and attribute transfer, the task of converting a sentence with one attribute (e.g., sentiment) to one with another; and (ii) solving SAT instances (classical problems requiring logical reasoning) using end-to-end neural networks.</div></div></div></div></div><div class="session"><div class="left"><div class="time">1:30 - 2:30pm</div><div class="session-title">Deep Learning Breakthrough</div><div class="speakers"><div class="speaker"><img class="photo" src="/images/speakers/3rd/Quoc_Le.jpg"><span class="name">Quoc Le</span><span class="position">Research Scientist</span><span class="company">Google Brain</span></div><div class="speaker"><img class="photo" src="/images/speakers/3rd/Sumit_Gulwani.jpg"><span class="name">Sumit Gulwani</span><span class="position">Partner Research Manager</span><span class="company">Microsoft</span></div></div></div><div class="right"><div class="session-title" id="deep-learning-breakthrough">Deep Learning Breakthrough</div><div class="speech"><div class="speech"><h3 class="speech-title"><span class="speaker-name">Quoc Le</span>&nbsp;:&nbsp;<span>Using Machine Learning to Automate Machine Learning (<a href=https://www.slideshare.net/AIFrontiers/quoc-le-at-ai-frontiers-using-machine-learning-to-automate-machine-learning >Slides</a>)</span></h3><div class="speech-description">Traditional machine learning systems are hand-designed and tuned by machine learning experts.

The IoT is predicated to bring trillions to many different industries. The fifth wave represents massive opportunity for the ecosystem to create new businesses and drive economic growth. Those 1T devices will not just be connected, they will be intelligent - a paradigm shift enabled by ML in every IoT end point. The bigger impact of AI is already happening today as machine learning is becoming part of our daily lives in billions of tiny moments. Machine Learning will be needed to handle the massive amount of data that will be part of the fifth wave. Data itself isn’t always valuable if the volume obscures the important info. We can use ML at the edge to identify the critical data that should be shared. This is why we as an industry need to focus on the edge for the future of AI. We’ve worked hard on moving data to processing somewhere else, but for a trillion devices, that approach isn’t sustainable. Moving, processing and storing data all has costs in terms of efficiency and security. We need to shift our focus to processing the data where it is collected and used driving more value from IoT.</div></div></div></div></div><div class="session"><div class="left"><div class="time">5:30 - 6:00pm</div><div class="session-title">Keynote</div><div class="speakers"><div class="speaker"><img class="photo" src="/images/speakers/3rd/Kai-Fu-Lee.jpg"><span class="name">Kai-Fu Lee</span><span class="position">Chairman & CEO</span><span class="company">Sinovation Ventures</span></div></div></div><div class="right"><div class="session-title" id="keynote">Keynote</div><div class="speech"><div class="speech"><h3 class="speech-title"><span class="speaker-name">Kai-Fu Lee</span>&nbsp;:&nbsp;<span>The Era of Artificial Intelligence (<a href=https://www.slideshare.net/AIFrontiers/kaifu-lee-at-ai-frontiers-the-era-of-artificial-intelligence >Slides</a>)</span></h3><div class="speech-description">In this talk, I will talk about the four waves of Artificial Intelligence (AI) , and how AI will permeate every part of our lives in the next decade.

Specifically we discuss the semantic parsing task for which natural language queries are converted to computation steps on knowledge graphs or data tables and produce the expected answers. State-of-the-art results can be achieved by novel memory structure for sequence models and improvements in reinforcement learning algorithms.
