Most games are well scoped; it is relatively easy to generate and use the data; and states/actions/rewards are relatively clear.

I will focus on two active areas: multimodality and time.  Video is naturally multi-modal, offering great possibility for content understanding while also opening new doors like unsupervised and weakly-supervised learning at scale.  Temporal representation remains a largely open problem; while we can describe a few seconds of video, there is no natural representation for a few minutes of video.  I will discuss recent progress, the importance of these problems for applications, and what we hope to achieve.</div></div></div><div class="speech"><div class="speech"><h3 class="speech-title"><span class="speaker-name">Divya Jain</span>&nbsp;:&nbsp;<span>Video Summarization</span></h3><div class="speech-description">As video content is becoming mainstream, video summarization is becoming a hot research topic in academia and industry.

We then suggest that more unsupervised learning settings can encourage the development of more robust systems.  We show positive results on two tasks: (i) text style and attribute transfer, the task of converting a sentence with one attribute (e.g., sentiment) to one with another; and (ii) solving SAT instances (classical problems requiring logical reasoning) using end-to-end neural networks.</div><div class="speech"></div></div></div><div class="session"><div class="left"><div class="time">1:30 - 2:30pm</div><div class="session-title">Deep Learning Breakthrough</div><div class="speakers"><div class="speaker"><img class="photo" src="/images/speakers/3rd/Quoc_Le.png"><span class="name">Quoc Le</span><span class="position">Research Scientist</span><span class="company">Google Brain</span></div><div class="speaker"><img class="photo" src="/images/speakers/3rd/Sumit_Gulwani.jpg"><span class="name">Sumit Gulwani</span><span class="position">Partner Research Manager</span><span class="company">Microsoft</span></div></div></div><div class="right"><div class="session-title" id="deep-learning-breakthrough">Deep Learning Breakthrough</div><div class="session-description">Leading scientists are presenting the current breakthrough in deep learning.

Our ability to learn task-specific functions for vision, language, sequence and control tasks is getting better at a rapid pace. This talk will survey some of the current advances in AI, compare AI to other fields that have historically developed over time, and calibrate where we are in the relative advancement timeline. We will also speculate about the next inflection points and capabilities that AI can offer down the road, and look at how those might intersect with other emergent fields, e.g. Quantum computing.</div></div></div><div class="session-description"><br><b>Banquet and Networking</b><br>The evening consists of sponsor pitch, and presentation from Jay Yagnik, VP of Google AI.

With technological advances over the years, AI has become increasingly popular and widely used in the gaming industry. The typical characteristics of games and game development makes them an ideal playground for practicing and implementing AI techniques, especially deep learning and reinforcement learning. Most games are well scoped; it is relatively easy to generate and use the data; and states/actions/rewards are relatively clear. In this talk, I will show a couple of use cases where ML/AI helps in-game development and enhances player experience. Examples include AI agents playing game and services that provide personalized experience to players.</div></div></div><div class="speech"></div></div></div><div class="session dim"><div class="left"><div class="time">3:10 - 3:30pm</div></div><div class="right"><div class="session-title">Coffee Break</div></div></div><div class="session"><div class="left"><div class="time">3:30 - 4:00pm</div><div class="session-title">VC Speech</div><div class="speakers"><div class="speaker"><img class="photo" src="/images/speakers/3rd/Sarah_Guo.jpg"><span class="name">Sarah Guo</span><span class="position">General Partner</span><span class="company">Greylock Partners</span></div></div></div><div class="right"><div class="session-title" id="vc-speech">VC Speech</div><div class="session-description">A look at the future of AI applications and potentials for AI investment.
